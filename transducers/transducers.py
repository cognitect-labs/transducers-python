"""
This is an implementation of Rich Hickey's Transducers from Clojure in Python.
It uses functional programming in Python and an alternative reduce which
recognizes Reduced, a sentinel wrapper with a value that can be extracted to
signal early termination.

Composed transducers result in a reversed composed process. E.g.,

> compose(map(f), filter(g))

Will apply f to the reduction step before filtering with g. This comes out of
the composition of transducers naturally as a transducer inserts its
transformation before the reducing function it accepts as an argument.

Transducers can be called with transduce or transduce into a collection with
into.
